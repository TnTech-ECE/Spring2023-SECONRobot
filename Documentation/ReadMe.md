# What should be in the documentation folder


## Signoffs

Signoffs are the detailed design documents for the project. They include detailed specification, buildable pdf schematic, analysis, and the bill of materials. Analysis is performed on components to prove that they are sufficient and will likely work. The signoffs that are in main have been approved by the supervisor, Mr. Jesse Roberts. Signoffs are included in a marddown file [here](/Documentation/Signoffs/).

### 3D Models

3D models are included [here](/Documentation/3D%20Models/).

The 3D models section will be updated throughout the project to reflect what has been signed off and designed. 

### Wiring Schematics

Electrical wiring schematics avaliable [here](/Documentation/Electrical/Schematics/).

The wiring schematics section will be updated throughout the project to reflect what has been signed off and designed. 

#### PCB files

Electrical wiring PCBs avaliable [here](/Documentation/Electrical/PCB/).

The PCB files section will be updated throughout the project to reflect what has been signed off and designed. 

## Final BOM

## Datasheet 

Each subsystems datasheet is essentially the signoff for that subsystem. The final datasheet will be created near the end of the project when the design is complete.
