# Team 2 Functional Prototype Substitution Request

## 1. Firework Video
- Substitude the completed firework video for sorting
  - The motor and color sensor parts have not come in yet

## 2. Motor Encoders
- Substitute working motor encoders for the tof distance sensors
  - The distance sensor parts have not come in yet
- Motor encoders were wired up, and they provide a precise number that shows position of the wheels and can be used to determine distance traveled and will be our feedback signal for the motors

## 3. Prototype Chassis
- Substitute the working proto chassis for pedestal storage
  - Proximity sensor for pedestal storage has not come in yet

## 4. Consumption
- Substitute consumption for duck storage
  - Fully functioning consumption
  - The servos and solenoid actuator parts have come in yet for duck storage
