# Team 2 Functional Prototype Substitution Request

## 1. Firework Video
- Substitude the completed firework video for the sorting minimally functional prototype
  - The motor and color sensor parts have not come in yet, so we would like to substitute the animated fireworks video which is automatically run by a Python script on a Raspberry Pi to emulate competition conditions.  

## 2. Motor Encoders
- Substitute working motor encoders for the tof distance sensors
  - The distance sensor parts have not come in yet
- Motor encoders were wired up, and they provide a precise number that shows position of the wheels and can be used to determine distance traveled and will be our feedback signal for the motors. The motor encoders are essential to reading distance traveled and were not initially part of the minimally functional prototype. 

## 3. Prototype Chassis
- Substitute the built proto-chassis for pedestal storage minimally functional expectation
  - Proximity sensor for pedestal storage has not come in yet

## 4. Consumption
- Substitute consumption for duck storage servo operation
  - Consumption will have motor and spokes connected. The consumption subsystem will be ready for experimentation and fully operational. 
  - The servos have not come in yet for duck storage, but the solenoid has and is functional
