# **Power Subsystem**
## **Function of The Subsystem** 
- Provides power to all other subsystems that require voltages and currents not supplied by the low-level controllers or the top level controller.
## **Constraints**
### **Size**

- Like all other subsystems, this subsystem is constrained by the size constraint of one cubic foot the robot must fit within at the beginning of the competition. To abide by this constraint, all the necessary components will be chosen with this constraint in mind and placed within the chassis in a strategic location as to save as much space as possible.

### **Vision** 
- sensors? (x8):
### **Feeding**
- Uhh idk man:
### **Fireworks**
- Servo?:
### **Socioeconomic Constraint**

- The final constraint is that this subsystem will provide the voltages and currents detailed in other subsystems as providing the highest operating efficiency. Not only will this allow other subsystems to work most efficiently, but also the power consumption and the battery charging costs will be less overall.
