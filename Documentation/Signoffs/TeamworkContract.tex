\section{How will the team be run?}
Below we describe the expectations for how our team will be managed for the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 Capstone terms. 
\section{Team Expectations}
Discuss and describe the team’s expectations regarding

\subsection{Participation (Engagement and effort in the project)}
Everyone should be participating in the group effort. We will hold a weekly meeting with the entire team at a set time. 
\subsection{Contribution (Progress on the project)}
Everyone should contribute to the group effort. Each member should have approximately equal contribution as much as possible. Each person will have individual contributions to the subject that is their focus as well as the main team effort.
\subsection{Communication}
We will establish a communications channel during the semester and stick with that centralized channel. We will not have several methods of communication throughout the semester to limit confusion. Important team messages should be sent in the group with all members of the team so that everyone is aware about unavailability for the team meeting or other topics that affect everyone. Everyone is expected to communicate within our main communication channel within a reasonable amount of time.
\subsection{Meetings}
We will hold weekly meetings that include the entire team that are required, but then we will add supplementary meetings as needed. One on one meetings between individuals working on similar portions will be held as necessary. If you can't attend, the team should be notified at least 24 hours beforehand with the exception of emergency situations. 
\subsubsection{How often is the team to meet?}
At the least, weekly meetings will be held. Additional meetings to be held at each member's discretion.
\subsection{Conduct}
Everyone should conduct themselves professionally, honestly, and respectfully. 
\subsection{Conflict}
We will have a majority rule voting system for making decisions. We will try to solve conflicts internally directly between those in conflict. If we are unable to settle issues internally, we will reach out to the proper person.
\subsection{Deadlines}
All deadlines are negotiable, but we will make the best attempt to meet the original deadline when possible. 
\section{Unique Roles}
Roles (all roles subject to change):
Nathan Gardner - Team Leader | Madison Kelly - Project Manager |  Fatima Al-Heji - Team Member | Luke McGill - Time Keeper | Mark Beech - Financial Advisor
\subsection{Responsibility}
Nathan Gardner - Maintains awareness of all aspects of the project and communicates with each member at least weekly. Ensures that all team members are following the Teamwork Contract. (Software, Networks, Systems)\\
Madison Kelly - Project Manager role assigns work based on strengths, interests, and the team's need. Ensures that work is evenly distributed across the team. Ensures that all team members are completing the work assignments. Communicates with the IEEE R3 leaders and hardware competition organizers when needed. (Hardware, Power)\\
Fatima Al-Heji - Reports project status updates to the team during meetings. Discuss top blockers or issues, big upcoming milestones, and general information. (Software and Hardware Design)\\
Luke McGill - Aware of how many hours spent per week on the project. (Software, Hardware, CAD)\\
Mark Beech - Aware of the budget and how much is being spent. Responsible for finding the best deals on components needed. Focus on hardware design, finding specifications needed and identifying components needed to meet specifications. (Hardware, Financial, PCB design)\\
\subsection{Describe what powers are granted to the role by the team (a leader must be empowered by the team)}
Majority decision making, so power is evenly distributed amongst members. 
\subsection{Does the role change the expectations outlined previously? If so, how?}
It does not change the expectations specifically, but adds extra responsibilities outlined above. 
\section{Team Member Rating}
Using the expectations outlined in question 2, discuss and describe a theoretical team member that the team would rate as…

\subsection{1/5}
No meaningful attempt was made.
\subsection{2/5}
Occasionally contributes, but is weak effort. 
\subsection{3/5}
Reasonable effort shown, but does not contribute at the same level as others on the team.
\subsection{4/5}
Team member met all expectations with genuine effort, but did not contribute at the same level as others on the team.
\subsection{5/5}
Team member met all expectations and contributed at the same level as others on the team.
