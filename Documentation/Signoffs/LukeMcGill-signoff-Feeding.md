# Feeding Subsystem

## Function

- Deliver the correct chip to the correct area based on color.

## Constraints

- The size of this subsystem will have to be such that it takes up as minimal space as possible.
- The servo motor must have a torque of at least 75 oz-in.
- The color sensor must be able to detect the red and green animal enclosures.
- The chips must be able to fit within their silos.

## Analysis

### Size

The tubes that the chips will be stored in must be able to fit the chips.

Chip Size $= 1.5 in \ast 0.1 in$
Tube Size $= 1.65 in \ast 0.5 in$

Therefore, the chips will comfortably fit inside the tubes.

### Torque

Weight of the chips $= 0.009 \frac{kg}{chip} \ast 6$ chips = 0.054 kg

$F = m \ast a = 0.054 \ast 9.81 = 0.52974 \frac{N}{m} = 75$ oz-in

The torque of the motor selected is 83 oz-in, so it will be more than sufficient for its cause.
