# Function of the subsystem 

The robot need to move in a predetermined path from the start point to the end point to collect all objects on the path, if the robot reached the end point, the robot must detect the colors of the spots on the arena ground and move toward the desired spot. Such as the duck pond is the blue spot, when the color have been identified, the robot must go to the desired spot or the duck pond. The robot must identify eight desired spots on the arena. each desired spot has diferent color and the robot will move toward each spot after identifing them. There will be Infrared Sensor and color sensor pluse the camera that will help the robot to do the task.

## Function

- Move in a predetermined path from the start point to the end point 
- using Camera, infrared Sensor, and color sensor to detect the desire spots
