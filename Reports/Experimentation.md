# **Experimental Analysis**

### **Cut Subsystems and Justification**

The following subsystems have been cut since the beginning of the project:
- Sorting
    - Due to size constraints and the parts for this subsystem not arriving, this subsystem was cut.
- Duck Storage and Delivery
    - The project was rescoped before the competition and the duck storage and delivery subsystem did not make it into the final implementation. This decision was made unanimously by the team at the competition. It was determined that the duck storage and delivery system, while well designed and theoretically functional, could not be reliably implemented before the competition. 
- Pedestal Storage and Delivery
    - Due to size constraints and the parts for this subsystem not arriving, this subsystem was cut.
- Vison
    - Due to the parts for this subsystem not arriving, this subsystem was cut.
- Consumption (repurposed - now called Delivery Subsystem)
    - The project was rescoped before the competition and the consumption subsystem did not make it into the final implementation. This decision was made unanimously by the team at the competition. The team decided to transition the consumption subsystem into the delivery subsystem. The direction of the motor was changed to push instead of consume, and the subsystem was used to push what items had been collected into the recycling area.


The following shall statements were closely related to these subsystems and therefore will not be discussed in this experimental analysis document:

- Shall design a robot which can find and move 90% of
the ducks into a holding area connected to the robot.
- Shall locate the duck pond in the center of the arena
within plus or minus one inch of error tolerance.
- Shall transport and place 90% of the ducks stored inside
the holding area to their final location in the duck pond.
- Shall find and move at least five pedestals into an internal
holding area inside the robot.
- Shall assemble one statue that is three pedestals tall and
one statue that is two pedestals tall using all five pedestals
obtained in order to maximize points obtained based on
discussion in weekly meetings.
- Shall place statues entirely inside the white inner circles
within plus or minus one inch of error tolerance.
- Shall place remaining unused pedestals that are held after
the five required pedestals have been obtained within the
internal holding area inside the robot.
- Shall move the extra pedestals obtained over the five
required pedestals in the recycling area.

## **Constraints from Signoffs:**

### **Full run from competition [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqyCZeEZ9IM&t=77s)**

## **General results from runs at the competition:**

For each run, there were ten ducks and seven pedestals randomly distributed on the arena as well as six food chips (3 red and 3 green) that the team could pre-load before the run started. The team had three minutes after the start switch was flipped to get as many points as possible. The results from these runs are shown below.

Below is the number of points scored in each round of the competition. If we had integrated the all functionality targeted after the rescope, we would have scored 86 points each round. 

Recycling: $2\ points * 17\ objects = 34\ points$

Feeding: $6\ correct chips * 7\ points = 42 \ points$

Fireworks: $1\ fireworks\ switch\ flip * 10\ points = 10\ points$

Total: $86\ points$

## **Feeding results:**

- **Purpose of Experiment**

    For this experiment, the team intends to measure the accuracy of the chip feeding mechanism implemented on the robot. 

- **Description**

    Experimentation was conducted during the runs at the competition. 

    For each run, there were ten ducks and seven pedestals randomly distributed on the arena as well as six food chips (3 red and 3 green) that the team could pre-load before the run started. The team had three minutes after the start switch was flipped to get as many points as possible. The robot had to navigate the field autonomously and no one could intervene on the robot in anyway or the round would end. 

- **Expectation (Prediction)**

    The expectation for this experiment was to consistently delivery food chips reliably. The team tested the robot in the build up to the competition and the robot was able to reliably deliver the food chips with error only on every third run. 

- **Number of trials** 

    The number of trials for this experiment was the number of round played at the competition, which was 6. 

- **Results** 

    - The design has been changed to two separate cups with two separate servo motors in order to simplify the design. The cups are only big enough to hold the chips, and are mounted on the servo motors which are mounted on the outer edge of the robot, thus saving much needed space inside the robot.

    The food chip dispensers can be seen in the image below. They are located on the top crossbar of the robots chassis. They consist of a cup connected to a servo motor.

    ![image](/Documentation/Images/finalcadmodel.png)

    Below is the final experimentation taken during the competition, we consistently delivered food chips, but did not meet the idealized goal of delivering 100% of the food chips correctly all of the time. 

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30758520/233709956-6bf99dc6-b242-4860-a47f-503b10eb8f78.png)

    - Since the design has been simplified in order to save time, the servos do not need to have as much torque. However, they have much more than sufficient torque needed to flip the cups and dump the chips during the competition. Servos purchased met requirements based on analysis performed in sign offs.

- **Interpretation**

    - Feeding was able to meet a high standard, but was unable to meet the 100% standard written in our project proposal. It can be seen from the results above that many of the points scored in the competition were from the feeding mechanism. 

    - In hindsight, the expectation for feeding from the project proposal was too high a standard, because it was very unlikely that this could have delivered the chips correctly in every attempt. 

## **Locomotion results:**

- **Weight of the robot**

The final competition robot weight was $14\ pounds\ or\ 6.35029\ kg\ \lt\ \approx\ 10.376\ kg$. 

This means the final weight of the robot was within specification defined in the constraints for the project. 

***Max Speed***

$\frac{150\ rotations}{1\ min} * \frac{1\ min}{60\ sec} * \frac{48\pi\ mm}{1\ rotation} * \frac{0.00328084\ feet}{mm} = 1.24 \frac{feet}{sec} \gt 0.0677 \frac{meter}{sec} = 0.222 \frac{feet}{second}\ (minimum\ speed\ requirement)$

***Typical Competition Speed***

$\frac{100\ rotations}{1\ min} * \frac{1\ min}{60\ sec} * \frac{48\pi\ mm}{1\ rotation} * \frac{0.00328084\ feet}{mm} = 0.825 \frac{feet}{sec}$

## **Power results:**

- The battery is sufficient in providing 12 V and over 2 A to meet the robotâ€™s needs. This was achieved with the original 12 V TalentCell battery as well as two 6 V MightMax batteries connected in series.

- The output of the TalentCell battery is regulated by the DC-DC Converter and provides a nearly constant 12 V to sufficiently power all components connected to it including the buck converter to the servo motors and the buck converter connected to the Jetson.

The multimeter was used to verify the output voltage of the DC/DC regulator while connected to the entire system to make sure the regulator output a steady 12 V output. The multimeter measured 
4 V or 11.95 V each trial.

- Fuses were not implemented in the final design.

- The 6 V servos were powered via a buck converter. As you can see below, there is a photo of both the buck converter outputs as well as the filtering circuits in order to filter the ripple voltage on the output. Measurements were taken with an oscilloscope before and after adding a the filter circuit.

Before filtering:

After Filtering:

The noise after adding the filter is less significant than without the filter. The amplitude is slightly lower and the noise dampens much quicker.

- The inductive load from the motors did not seem to be an issue, so the team decided to not add the capacitors on the power input to the motors.

- The main power bus in the robot was supplied from two 6 V MightyMax batteries in series. This bus was connected to all the locomotion DC motor drivers. One of these 6 V battery was used to power the 6 V motor driver for the delivery subsystem. A separate bus was created for powering the Jetson and the servo motors, and it was supplied from the 12 V TalentCell battery. All power connections had a common ground. 

- The team was having issues with the Jetson giving an undercurrent message from the 5 V USB output despite the analysis showing that it would be enough. The decision was made to implement another buck converter in order to deliver 5.20 V to supply the Jetson from the regulated 12 V output instead of from the 5 V USB output on the TalentCall battery.

The undercurrent message was actually a general error message, and the issue was an undervoltage condition. This was caused by the large amount of current the Jetson draws and the resistance of the charging wire inducing a voltage drop across the wire. This is the reason that the team set the buck converter to generate 5.20 V to supply the Jetson. 

The multimeter was connected to the output of the buck converter while connected to the rest of the system to verify.

Further measurements were made on the 6 V batteries to verify the voltages of the batteries with just one of the batteries and both in series. The batteries were connected to the system as a whole and they were under load.

## **Delivery Subsystem (was called Consumption) results:**

- The team did not use the initially purchased 6 V motor. The initially purchases motor was too slow and allowed items to fall down through the consumption before it hit it again. The team used a faster 6 V motor that was available in the capstone lab. 

- Many variations of spokes have been tested in order to see which ones work the best. The only spokes that were used in the final implementation were curved TPU spokes, and those can be seen in the final total robot CAD model in this document. 

- The size of the final consumption implementation was 5.25"x9.25"x11.75" (LxWxH). The consumption mechanism is large enough for a duck to be consumed as well as the pedestals, while also being within specification for the robot size set by the competition.

Note: In the final implementation in the competition, no ducks or pedestals were consumed. The motor direction of the consumption motor was reversed and the consumption was converted into a pusher. The robot collected objects in the arena on the consumption ramp, and then the spokes pushed out the objects into the recycling. 

- There are three walls surrounding the intake in order to protect any limbs from moving parts. This was a safety feature implementation based on considerations made during detailed design. 

The chart below conveys the effectiveness of the delivery subsystem on the robot.

## **Fireworks results:**

- The robot has the force necessary to flip the switch without issue, though it did not flip the switch during the competition. 

Video Demonstration of the Fireworks Switch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUixtoiBSds)

## **Measures of Success from Project Proposal**
- The team rescoped and decided not to start using the LED indicator to instead focus on other subsystems. A start switch was added to replace this functionality. 

- The robot was unable to drop all the chips in the correct location on every competition run. A table showing all points scored is shown in the feeding section under the shall statements.

- The project was rescoped to remove duck storage and therefore did not collect and store any ducks. They were instead be pushed to the recycle area.

- The robot was unable to flip the light switch during the six competition rounds. The python script has been written as well as the video has been made as of March 10, 2023.

- Due to the sorting, consumption, and pedestal storage subsystems being cut or repurposed, the pedestals will no longer be consumed, sorted, or stacked. Instead, pedestals will be pushed to recycling just like the ducks.

- The robot's path was altered to push as many objects as possible into the recycle area, instead of placing any remaining items into the recycle area.

## **Shall Statements**

### **Power:** 

- Shall design an autonomous robot with a single start
button, allowing the robot to start moving through its
environment.

    - The start button was implemented as a start switch. This starts the path for the robot. This is shown in the full round video at the top of this document. 
    
- The robot will have a single emergency stop button at a
point that is easily accessible and can be safely reached,
which will shut down all physical movement performed
by the robot in the case of an emergency.

    - The E-stop button is easily accessible on the top of the robot. The switch cuts all power to the dc motors for locomotion and delivery. his is shown in the full round video at the top of this document.

- Shall create an easily reachable (not blocked by motors,
chassis, wheels, or any other object) emergency cut off
switch to allow the team to disable the robot in the case
of an emergency.

    - The E-stop button is easily accessible on the top of the robot. his is shown in the full round video at the top of this document.

- Shall have a self-latching emergency stop push-button
that has a positive operation. The button shall not be a
graphical representation or a flat switch based on NFPA
79 - 10.7.2. [1] This constraint addresses the need for the
addition of practical engineering standards.

    - The E-stop button chosen meets these specifications.

Video demonstration of E-stop [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuQbhPMOLbw).

- Shall abide by the Department of Energy Standard 79
FR 7845 in the teamâ€™s purchase or design of wall warts
for energy conservation and efficiency. [3] This constraint
addresses an ethical consideration by better ensuring the
safety of the team and all others interacting with the robot
as well as the addition of ethical standards.

    - The wall wart bought with the TalentCell battery abides by this standard.

### **Software:**

- Shall represent knowledge using IEEE standard IEEE
1872-2015 Ontologies for Robotics and Automation used
to represent knowledge about the typography of the arena.
This ontology will be used to represent relationships
between the landmarks in the area and what is known.
It should not change during the competition, so it can be
predefined. [2]

    - We ended up using encoder distances to represent the movement and position in the arena. This was written during the conceptual design when we had been considering using SLAM to navigate the arena area. 

### **Feeding:**

- Shall design an autonomous robot that will earn all
possible points for delivering 100% of the correct food
chips to both the manatees and alligators.

    - This was accomplished in the first two rounds of the competition, but was not accomplished in the later rounds of the competition. 

### **Fireworks:** 
- Shall design an autonomous robot that will be able to flip
a switch from left to right.

- Shall design an animated fireworks MPEG video and
write a Python script that will play the video when
activated by the switch.

    - This fireworks video was created, and won second place in a separate competition for most creative fireworks video. It was judged based on creativity and school spirit. 
    
### **Chassis:**
- Chassis will be designed with an aluminum frame. Alu-
minum is abundantly available under the earthâ€™s surface
and mining can be offset with post-mining rehabilitation
and efficient recycling. This constraint will lessen the
broader impact the team has on the environment.

    - The chassis was constructed using Aluminum extrusion 80 x 20.
